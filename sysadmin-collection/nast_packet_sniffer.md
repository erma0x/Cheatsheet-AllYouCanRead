    To protect against such attacks, an organization can use the following methods.
  
    A policy that prohibits users from downloading unnecessary files from the Internet such as spam email attachments, games, programs that claim to speed up downloads, etc.
   
    Anti-virus software must be installed on all user computers. The anti-virus software should be updated frequently, and scans must be performed at specified time intervals.
    
    Scan external storage devices on an isolated machine especially those that originate from outside the organization.
    
    Regular backups of critical data must be made and stored on preferably read-only media such as CDs and DVDs.
    
    Worms exploit vulnerabilities in the operating systems. Downloading operating system updates can help reduce the infection and replication of worms.
    
    Worms can also be avoided by scanning, all email attachments before downloading them.
