Jenkins workflow:
    Create a git repository or use an existing one
    Dev team have the responsibility to commit the code to Dev-Branch
    Jenkins will fetch the code from Github and will map with the job enabled for a specific task
    We will make sure that CI and CD is done for the job/task
    Jenkins will pull the code and will enter the commit phase of the task
    Jenkins then will compile code and its called build phase of the task
    The code is deployed by Jenkins after the code is merged to Master branch by DevOps team and the job is started for a specific application
    The code is ready to be deployed and enter the deployment phase cycle
    The code after deployed from Jenkins then get deployed to the server using docker container
    After the code is working fine in staging server with unit testing, Same code then is deployed on the production server
