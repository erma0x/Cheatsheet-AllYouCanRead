One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

Store config in the environment

Treat backing services as attached resources

Strictly separate build and run stages

Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

Export services via port binding

Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

Processes should also be robust against sudden death

Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
Make the time gap small
Make the tools gap small: keep development and production as similar as possible.

A twelve-factor app never concerns itself with routing or storage of its output stream. 
the stream can be sent to a log indexing and analysis system such as Splunk, or a general-purpose data warehousing system such as Hadoop/Hive.


Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
